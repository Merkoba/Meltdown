You will need [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) installed.

---

You might be able to install with `pipx`:

```sh
pipx install git+https://github.com/madprops/meltdown
```

Which should provide the `meltdown` command.

---

To install manually use a virtual env and `requirements.txt`.

You can use `scripts/venv.sh` to automate this.

To run it use `run.sh`.
